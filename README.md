# 👋 Hi, I'm Benedek  

I’m a **15-year-old developer** with a strong passion for **backend systems, programming, and problem-solving**.  
Currently studying **Harvard’s CS50x**, I’m building a solid foundation in **C, Python, web technologies, and databases**.  

Growing up in a **multicultural environment** (Spanish + Hungarian) and teaching myself **English (C1 in programming, B2+ in general)** has shaped me into a fast learner who adapts quickly.  
At just 13, I launched my own **Minecraft network**, which introduced me to servers, teamwork, and technical challenges—experiences that continue to fuel my interest in software engineering.
